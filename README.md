## Bugs and Known Issues

- More contact info and responsive UI clean up needed

## Next Steps to Continue

### Next Steps for App UI and Functionality

- More accessiblity like hover text info
- More browser compatibility css and @media queries to clean up some responsive scaling
- Add more accessibility (label ever form control / page lang idenity / all interactive elements keyboard accessible like sliders)
- Hover, Focus and other accessibilty standards need some tweaking
- test and clean up run time efficiency based on Google Analytics (organize acct structure / includes and excludes checklist ect..)
- Code Clean up CSS: set up global variables in SCSS for reusables (fonts, colors, headings and other elements ect...)
- Create more reusable classes and class combos in CSS as well as changing some classes to id's if only used once
- Set more standards for basic elements in CSS
- add Sass or Less structure that compiles to one CSS for code organizastion and better css nesting/functional variables 

### Next Steps for Code

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

### My Interpretation of the Acceptance Criteria:
- homework 2 acceptance criteria:
- display name
- display profile photo
- 3 sections in nav that are links that when clicked scroll to the section in the page:
- about paragraph
- body of work
- contact info
- body of work should have:
- titles with images/screenshots of work 3 - 5 examples (fake for now)
- first image is larger than the other
- all images are clickable links that take to the deployed app (fake for now) that the image/screenshot shows
- entire page is responsive from desktop (max 990 or so) to mobile (min 300px or so) 
- encouraged to use what we just learned to make this happen: flexbox / @media queries / css variables
